## Introduction

This program is my program for composition, and has been a joy to both create
and work with. It is free and licensed under the GNU Public License. I hope you
find it useful in your work with sound.

Many thanks to all of the users who have been so gracious as to send me feedback,
suggestions, bugs, and feature requests, as it's all helped Blue grow over time.

## Where to Start

If this is your first time using Blue, you might want to check out the manual,
which is available within the program from Help menu (the "Blue Manual" menu
option).  A version of the manual is also available [online](https://blue.kunstmusik.com/manual/html/index.html). The blue-users mailing list, accessible from
https://blue.kunstmusik.com, is also a great place to ask questions.

Example .blue project files are provided in the examples folder, located in the
directory where blue is installed. (Note for OSX, if you are using the blue
application, you can find the example folder within the blue.app by
right-clicking the application and exploring the contents.)

If you ever have any problems or discussions, please feel free to mail the
mailing list or email me anytime!

Thanks,
Steven
